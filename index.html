                    <p>
                        Hello
                        My name is Rubival Santos, but my friends call me Rubinho Lima. This is also how I am known
                        at
                        work.
                        I own a production logistics company specialized in TV shows called Atrium Solutions.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        At age 22 I graduated with a bachelors degree in Computer Science at Universidade Salvador,
                        in
                        Brazil.
                        My first employment experience was with the IT department of Emilio Odebrecht Foundation, a
                        well-known
                        organization in Brazil.
                        After just a few months of employment, I was selected to work for a local TV station called
                        TV
                        Bahia, in
                        the IT support area.
                        While there I used to spend my lunch break everyday near the journalism production
                        department. I
                        gradually used my computer
                        skills to improve the broadcasting of evening news stories throughout the State of Bahia.
                    </p>


                    <p>
                        My work was soon recognized and I was transferred to the largest television network in
                        Brazil.
                        I spent most of my career in Brazil working for Rede Globo. There I worked with the
                        production
                        of
                        soap
                        operas,
                        entertainment and sports shows, as well as the transmission of soccer matches and F-1 races.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In 2000 I moved with my family to the United States where I continued to work with
                        production
                        logistics.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As I grew older and more experienced, I decided that it was time to return to my
                        professional
                        origins.
                        So today I am back at school to study Computer Programming. I am very pleased to be part of
                        a
                        reputable
                        university,
                        studying what I like and feeling blessed to have all the support of the teachers, TA's, the
                        staff.
                        With
                        their support
                        I will reach my career goals. I can only be grateful and be proud of it!
